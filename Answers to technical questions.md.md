Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
	
   55 mins  
   
   What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

   There can be further improvements, but it is quite complete for its own purposes.

2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
	
	It is one of the most feature rich and productive language when it comes to web development.

3. What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)? 

	Laravel in general is amazingly simple to use and work with providing you countless useful and esay too use tools and ready to use solutions.
	It supports high productivity and rapid development process with out of the box components and packages. 

	The resulting code that you create on top of the framework base is most of the time beautifully elegant, concise, easy to maintain and extend. This is caused by the framework building on well know, best practice design patterns to support crreatic generic solutions on top of it.

	Laravel is well documented, and it has a big, supportive community and huge knowledge base to find information and ready to use examples of solving most of the usual things needed in web development. 

4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?

	Your solution can easily become dependent on lot of external libraries / packages and the framework itself that are out of your control.
	
	The framework and packages possibly need upgrading - for example because of security reasons - 
	and this can be hard and sometimes painful because of tackling possible hardware / software incompatibilities.

	Error messages can be more criptic and verbose, result harder to debug code, compared to using only vanilla PHP. (eg. usage of lot of magic methods)

	Understanding and digging into core framework code is sometime hard 
	and needs very advanced knowledge of the field, but without it it is not possible to fully understand the whole codebase of your own application. Also most of the time pointless and even impossible to familiarise yourself with all the under the hood codes and implementations of the framework itself, and these can also change sometimes quite rapidly making hard to keep track with these changes.

	It provides very generic - and as a result sometime quite big and bloated - solutions to generic problems, making sure they can be used in the widest varieties of cases supporting the rapid development of all possible cases. The downside of this is that you could create something much simpler for just solving your specific problem.

	It can be more problematic to scale up with a framework then without.
	Also memory / CPU usage etc.. of a framwork based code can be less efficient 
	and possibly need special treatments later when scaling up.
